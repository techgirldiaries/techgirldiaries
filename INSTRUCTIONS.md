# Usage Instructions

1.  Fork this repo and name it `<your-username>`
2.  In your forked repo, go to the `Settings tab > Actions > General`. In the `Workflow Permissions` section, toggle `Read and Write permissions` and press `Save`. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
3.  Go to the `Actions` tab, select `Generate Animation` and click `Run Workflow`. That way, you will manually generate your first snake animation svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 24 hours.
4.  On line 1, rename `page_id` url param to `<your-username>.<your-username>`
5.  On line 4, rename `lines` url param to whatever you`d like
6.  Customise lines 9-21 to fit your description
7.  Customise your Socials section (26-34)
8.  Customise your Tools section (39-43)
9.  On line 52, change `/techgirldiaries/techgirldiaries/` to `/<your-username>/<your-username>/`. This will make sure that you're fetching your snake contributions svg and not mine.
10. In your stats section (line 62), rename `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs?username=techgirldiaries` to `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs?username=<your-username>`.
11. In the second stats section (line 63), rename `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?/username=techgirldiaries` to `https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?/username=<your-username>`. The first and second one are my private instances of the repository I used, so my private contributions are taken into account as well. Hosting your private instance of github-readme-stats on Vercel is quite a simple process and recommended; if you're interested, click [here](https://github.com/techgirldiaries/github-readme-stats#deploy-on-your-own).
12. Add another typing animation to your footer or customise your support link (line 73-74).
13. You're good to go! Make sure to leave a star‚≠ê if you like this repo!
